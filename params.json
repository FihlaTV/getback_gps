When finished, you have to find your car again, or the way to the station, or any other point where you started.\r\nThen the Ariadne app is what you need. Store a location when you start your trip, and at the end of the day, use the app to find your way back to where you started.\r\n\r\nMore info on our [website](https://github.com/ruleant/getback_gps/wiki).\r\n\r\nBugs and feature requests\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs and add feature requests in the Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/ruleant/getback_gps/issues).\r\n\r\nRequests for translations to a new language can be made here as well.\r\n\r\nTranslation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou can help translating the app to your own language : <http://hosted.weblate.org/projects/getback_gps/strings>.\r\n\r\n[![Translation status](http://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/getback_gps-287x66-grey.png)](http://hosted.weblate.org/engage/getback_gps/?utm_source=widget)\r\n\r\nIs your language not listed?
